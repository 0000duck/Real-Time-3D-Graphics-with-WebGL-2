**Build Interactive 3D Applications with JavaScript and WebGL 2 (OpenGL ES 3.0)**


## What Is This Book About?
As highly interactive applications have become an increasingly important part of the user experience, WebGL is a unique and cutting-edge technology that brings hardware-accelerated 3D graphics to the web.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the rendering pipeline provided in WebGL
* Build and render 3D objects with WebGL
* Develop lights using shaders, 3D math, and the physics of light reflection
* Create a camera and use it to navigate a 3D scene
* Use texturing, lighting, and shading techniques to render realistic 3D scenes

### Running Examples Locally
If you do not have a web server, we recommend you install a lightweight web server from the following options:

- Serve: https://github.com/zeit/serve
- Lighttpd: http://www.lighttpd.net
- Python Server: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server

To run the examples locally on your machine, run your server from the root of the directory, since the `common` directory is a shared dependency across chapters.
